## Hello ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Physics MSc student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. I also work with the Future Circular Collider collaboration at CERN on machine learning-based Particle Flow algorithm.

:electron: I'm interested in applications of deep learning in particle physics: Firstly, can we improve existing algorithms to make better use of the existing experimental data? Secondly, can we design algorithms that would enable us to optimize future detectors to better target areas left unexplored by the existing detectors?
